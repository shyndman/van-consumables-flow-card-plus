## Goal

The Goal of this card is to provide an easy to understand and visualize way of displaying the current Power Distribution coming from and to different sources, such as solar, grid, home batteries etc. Furthermore, this card aims to expose a lot of customizability and control of its behavior to the configuration, allowing users to tailor it to their specific requirements.

## Scope

This card **does not** aim to display Energy Values (Meaning accumulated power over 1 day, for example).
If this is your goal, check out the [Energy Flow Card Plus](https://github.com/flixlix/energy-flow-card-plus).

## Guides

In case you want to watch a tutorial instead of reading through this very long readme 😅, I recommend the following videos:

- [Power Flow Card Plus in Home Assistant - Jetzt noch besser? Anleitung from Smartzeug](https://youtu.be/PUOU5qdhMro) - _in german_, up to date with version 0.2.2
- [Power Flow Card Plus for Home Assistant from Speak to the Geek](https://youtu.be/C4Zh35E9wJE?si=REuWZxmfF91G0Ht7) - _changes in indvidual configuration_

## Installation

### HACS (recommended)

This card is directly available through [HACS](https://hacs.xyz). To install HACS, follow these [instructions](https://hacs.xyz/docs/setup/prerequisites).
After having HACS installed, simply search for "Power Flow Card Plus" and download it using the UI 🙂

<details>
<summary>Manual install</summary>

1. Download and copy `van-consumables-flow-card-plus.js` from the [latest release](https://github.com/flixlix/van-consumables-flow-card-plus/releases/latest) into your `config/www` directory.

2. Add the resource reference as decribed below.

### Add resource reference

If you configure Dashboards via YAML, add a reference to `van-consumables-flow-card-plus.js` inside your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
resources:
  - url: /local/van-consumables-flow-card-plus.js
    type: module
```

Else, if you prefer the graphical editor, use the menu to add the resource:

1. Make sure, advanced mode is enabled in your user profile (click on your user name to get there)
2. Navigate to Settings -> Dashboards
3. Click three dot icon
4. Select Resources
5. Hit (+ ADD RESOURCE) icon
6. Enter URL `/local/van-consumables-flow-card-plus.js` and select type "JavaScript Module".
   (Use `/hacsfiles/van-consumables-flow-card-plus/van-consumables-flow-card-plus.js` and select "JavaScript Module" for HACS install if HACS didn't do it already)

</details>

## Usage

> [!WARNING]
> This card offers a **LOT** of configuration options. Don't worry, if you want your card's appearance to match the oficial Energy Flow Card, you will only need to setup the entities. The rest of the options only enable further customization. If this is your goal, please go to [Minimal Configuration](#minimal-configuration)

| display_zero           | `boolean`         | Default is `false`. If set to `true` info will still be displayed if state of the entity is `0` or `unavailable`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| display_zero_tolerance | `number`          | If set, the device will be displayed if the state is greater than the tolerance set. No need to set `display_zero` property to true.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| decimals               | `number`          | The number of decimal places to round the value to.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| template               | `string`          | Here you can enter a [HA Template](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/templating/). The output of the template will be displayed.

Will update automatically in case one of the provided entities inside the template updates. Can only be used in case `entity` was not set. |
| accept_negative        | `boolean`         | Default is `false`. If set to `true`, negative values will be displayed as negative, otherwise they will be transformed to positive                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

#### Power Outage

This feature allows you to configure how the card handles a Grid Power Outage scenario.

| Name                | Type                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| entity              | `string` required     | Entity ID providing a state that changes when there is a Power Outage. (eg: `binary_sensor.grid_connection_status`). Doesn't need to be a binary_sensor.                                  |
| entity_generator    | `string`              | Entity ID providing the power of a Generator. (eg: `sensor.generator_power`). This is optional, meaning if you don't use this, the card will assume the grid is the only source of power. |
| state_alert         | `string`              | The state the provided entity is at when there is a power outage. Default is `on`, meaning if the entity's state is `on` the card will assume there is a power outage.                    |
| icon_alert          | `string`              | An icon path to be override the grid icon when there is a power outage. Default is `mdi:transmission-tower-off`.                                                                          |
| label_alert         | `string`              | A text that will be displayed below the icon when there is a power outage.                                                                                                                |
| calculate_flow_rate | `boolean` or `number` | `false`                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|                     |                       | If set to `true`, the flow rate will be calculated by using the flow rate formula (either the new or the old one, depending on your configuration). If set to a number, the flow rate will be set to that number. For example, defining the value `10` will ensure one dot will flow every 10 seconds. |

#### Display Zero Lines

This object allows you to control the behavior of the flow lines that are inactive.

| Name         | Type                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------ | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| mode         | string                        | Valid Options are: `show`, `hide`, `transparency`, `grey_out`, `custom`                                                                                                                     |
| transparency | number                        | A number between 0 and 100. 100 means the line doesn't show at all. 0 means the line shows in full opacity. Default is 50. Will be used when the mode is either `transparency` or `custom`. |
| grey_color   | `string` or `list of numbers` | Either a HEX Code or a List of three numbers between 0 and 255 in RGB order. Will be used when the mode is either `grey_out` or `custom`.                                                   |

### Minimal Configuration

> Don't forget to change the entity ids

The following configurations will allow you to achieve your results with the least amount of lines of code / complexity.

### UI Editor (available in version 0.2)

> [!TIP]
> I've made a lot of improvements in version 0.2 for the UI-Editor. Now each field has its own subpage, meaning there is now much less scrolling.
> The biggest change in the editor is the fact that you can now add up to 4 individual devices, all through the UI! 🥳

![ui-editor](https://github.com/flixlix/van-consumables-flow-card-plus/assets/61006057/a5d0cbb4-f430-4ba0-9c6f-8c93689206d7)

### Flow Formula

This formula is based on the official formula used by the Energy Distribution card.

```js
max - (value / totalLines) * (max - min);
// max = max_flow_rate
// min = min_flow_rate
// value = line value, solar to grid for example
// totalLines = gridConsumption + solarConsumption + solarToBattery +
//   solarToGrid + batteryConsumption + batteryFromGrid + batteryToGrid
```

### New Flow Formula

In contrast to the old flow formula, this formula calculates the flow rate independently from other lines, making it more intuitive to interpret the perceived power. This means that a state of `10W` will always flow with the same velocity, no matter what other lines are doing. In other words this flow rate is calculated in absolute and not relative values.

To get this new Flow Formula to work, simply set `use_new_flow_rate_model` in the main configuration to true. You may want to play around with the `max_expected_power`, `min_expected_power`, `max_flow_rate` and `min_flow_rate` to get the speeds that you wish

```js
if (value > maxIn) return maxOut; // In case power exceeds maximum expected power, use the fastest speed and ignore the rest.
return ((value - minIn) * (maxOut - minOut)) / (maxIn - minIn) + minOut;

// value = value of the current line to calculate (eg: grid to home)
//
// minIn = amount of watts at which the lowest speed will be selected.
//   ↳ In your configuration this is `min_expected_power`
//   ↳ eg: setting this at `100` means that at `100` watts, the dots will still flow at the lowest speed
// maxIn = amount of watts at which the highest speed will be selected.
//   ↳ In your configuration this is `max_expected_power`
//   ↳ eg: setting this at `2000` means that everything more than `2000` will flow at the highest speed selected
//
// minOut = amount of watts at which the lowest speed will be selected.
//   ↳ In your configuration this is `max_flow_rate`
//   ↳ eg: setting this at `5` means that one dot will take `5` second to travel
// maxOut = amount of watts at which the highest speed will be selected.
//   ↳ In your configuration this is `min_flow_rate`
//   ↳ eg: setting this at `1` means that one dot will take `1` second to travel
```

The following video aims to show the diffence between the two flow formulas:

<https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61006057/231479254-91d6c625-8f38-4abb-b9ba-8dd24d6395f3.mp4>

Notice that when the Power changes to only coming from the sun, the old formula accelerates to maintain a constant amount of dots/second.
Using the new formula is more intuitive, since you can immediately see that the Solar Power is relatively low since the dots are flowing very slowly.
On the old Flow Formula you might think that the sun is producing a lot of power, which in this case is not true.

At the end of the day these are two options and depending on what you're interested, one might suit you better than the other, that's why I kept the old formula, you have the choice. 🙂
